This is an Algorithmic Trader for both US Stocks and Cryptocurrency. 
The money traded is paper money and not for any profit making.
Binance and Alpaca API were used for the Cyrptocurrency and US Stocks respectively.

# Most Important:-

This project was coded using Chatgpt, each part was seperately created and then integrated into one, with few changes made by me in the algorithmic logic and workings.

The sole purpose of this project was my curiosity in algorithmic trading. Since I could not code such a big project due to both lack of knowledge and time this project was coded using AI.

This was my second project using API just to understand how finance could be integrated and automated by programs.
