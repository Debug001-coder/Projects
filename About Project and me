LinkedIn Profile Search Automation

About This Project

This project is a small experimental tool that automates LinkedIn profile searches using the Google SERP API (SerpAPI).
It was an interesting project I came across on LinkedIn itself, but the execution and coding were done with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

I have made several tweaks to the code, added filtering features, and plan to extend it further.

This project is not meant for professional use but as a demonstration of:

1:-My curiosity in automation and data projects

2:-My ability to learn, adapt, and experiment with new technologies

3:-How I leverage AI to turn ideas into working prototypes

Planned Features in Future

1:-Introductory mailing to the found profiles

2:-Auto-connect functionality to send connection requests

3:-More granular filters:

4:-Job titles

5:-Years of experience

6:-Skills/keywords

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for learning and exploration purposes only.
I do not claim ownership of the entire code — it was developed with AI assistance and extended with my own ideas and modifications.

It is not intended to be used in a way that violates LinkedIn’s Terms of Service or data privacy guidelines.
